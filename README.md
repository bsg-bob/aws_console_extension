# AWS console header color

### Description
This extension changes the AWS console header color depending on the region you selected. This visual hint will help you avoid creating resources in the wrong region !
It also adds the code along the region, by example for London : eu-west-2, and a flag corresponding to the contry the region belongs to.

Remember that the console is useful but the AWS cloud is optimised for automation, consider using the CLI or Cloudformation !

This extension required the "tabs" privilege to dynamically update the colors of the headers in the tabs when you customize them. It won't collect, read or transmit any data of any kind.

### Compatibility
Since Firefox Quantum, the extensions / addons management is now almost the same between the two platforms. Chrome doesn't like the browser_specific_settings entry and displays a warning but that's all.
The packaging is a but different : Chrome takes a zip of the rool folder while firefox want a zip of the files, without the root directory.
